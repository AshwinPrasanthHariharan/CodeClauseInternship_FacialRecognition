# Facial Recognition System

This is an intermediate-level facial recognition project developed during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodeClause.

## 🔍 Project Summary
The goal of this project is to build a system that can identify and verify faces in images using the `face_recognition` library (built on top of dlib). It demonstrates core concepts in biometric verification.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition

## 📂 Files Included
- `facial_recognition.py`: Facial recognition code comparing two images
- `Project_Report.txt`: Detailed project documentation

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:

2. Add two images:
- `known.jpg` – The reference image
- `unknown.jpg` – The test image to compare

3. Run the script:

4. Output will be printed to the console:  
`Face matched!` or `Face not matched.`

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Facial feature encoding using deep learning
- Image processing with OpenCV
- Practical understanding of real-world face recognition systems
