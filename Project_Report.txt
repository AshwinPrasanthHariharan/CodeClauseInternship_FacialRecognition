Project Title: Facial Recognition System
Project Level: Intermediate Level
Internship Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, face_recognition
Duration: 03 May 2025 â€“ 03 Jun 2025

Project Overview:
This project involves developing a facial recognition system capable of identifying and verifying faces in static images. It uses the 'face_recognition' library built on top of dlib for facial encoding and comparison.

Key Features:
- Load known and unknown images
- Encode facial features using HOG-based detection
- Compare face encodings for recognition

Outcome:
Hands-on understanding of face detection, feature encoding, and verification processes in biometric systems.
